       <strong>* </strong>HTML5 and CSS3 have just arrived (kinda), and with them a whole new battle for the ‘best markup’ trophy has begun. Truth to be told, all these technologies are mere tools waiting for a skilled developer to work on the right project.
      As developers we shouldn’t get into pointless discussions of which markup is the best. They all lead to nowhere. <br/><br/><strong>* </strong>Rather, we must get a brand new ideology and modify our coding habits to keep the web accessible. While it is
      true HTML5 and CSS3 are both a work in progress and is going to stay that way for some time, there’s no reason not to start using it right now. After all, time’s proven that implementation of unfinished specifications does work and can be easily
      mistaken by a complete W3C recommendation.<br/> <br/><strong>* </strong>That’s were Progressive Enhancement and Graceful Degradation come into play. The tag defines a footer for a document or section. A lot element should contain information about its
      containing element. A f element typically contains: authorship information copyright information contact information sitemap back to top links related documents You can have several elements in one document.
