    <p>When starting the design of a website, one of the early decisions you should take is whether you want a fixed-width layout or a liquid layout (also called flexible layout or fluid layout) for your website. Both the styles have their pros and cons
      although the fixed-width layout is by far the more popular and preferred layout. This article explains the pros and cons of opting for a liquid layout and why a fixed-width layout is a safer and more preferred option. Using Cascading Style Sheets
      (CSS), a website can be designed in such a way that its contents resize themselves to occupy the entire width of the screen, depending on the resolution of the person visiting your site. This can be an effective way to minimize the need for scrolling,
      especially if your website does not use technologies that do not lend themselves to resizing easily. The image shown here is a good example of a liquid layout. Depending on the screen resolution, the website contents get rearranged to occupy the
      entire screen width. While there are distinct advantages to using a liquid layout, it also has its limitations. Below are some of the pros and cons of using a liquid layout for your website.
    <ul><strong>* Liquid Layout can be User Friendly</strong></ul>No one likes to scroll through pages on a website. Many times, with higher screen resolutions, there is a lot of space that is left blank on a web page, making the user scroll down to read content.
      This can be minimized with the use of a liquid layout. Since a liquid layout site will rearrange the content to occupy the available screen width, the content can be distributed to occupy the width of higher resolutions, thereby minimizing the need
      for scrolling.
    <ul><strong>* Liquid Layouts can be Visually Appealing	</strong></ul>
     Most industry-standard browsers will render a page with a fluid layout similarly. In other words, the white spaces between columns will appear the same on most browsers. This means that,
      although the page layout varies depending on the screen resolution of the user, it can still look visually appealing and uniform across browsers using the same screen resolution.
